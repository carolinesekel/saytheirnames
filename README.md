Slideshow using [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) of the names of Black transgender individuals that have been killed in 2020. Inspired by the last project in my web development course through [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com/student), I wanted to use the slideshow format to honor those whose lives were taken and bring attention to some organizations offering assistance to Black trans people. 

Names to be updated if needed. Create an issue or pull request to contribute additional resources, organizations etc!
